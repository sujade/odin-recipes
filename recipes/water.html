    <p>Have you ever had such a good glass of water that it made you feel like, <em>wow, that's the stuff</em>?</p>
    <p>Here's your ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A glass</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Don't let the steps confuse you now!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your class and make sure that the part with the opening is facing up.</li>
        <li>Place the glass on a flat surface.</li>
        <li>Pour some water into it.</li>
        <li>Grab the glass and drink the water.</li>
    </ol>
