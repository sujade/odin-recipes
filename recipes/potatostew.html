    <h1>Mama's Potato Stew</h1>

<img src="../images/potatostew.jpg">

    <p>A hearty, loving dish from Mediterranean Region of Turkey. This dish could be eaten by itself as well but I prefer cooking it with <strong>rice.</strong></p>
    <p>It can be made vegan as well if you use vegan <em>minced meat</em></p>
    <p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This dish includes a very Turkish ingredient called <em>Salcha</em>. You can probably find it in Middle-Eastern or Turkish stores.</p>

    <p><strong>Now let's check the ingredients out:</strong></p>
    <div class="container">
    <ul class="ul">
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>Some green peppers</li>
        <li>500g of minced meat or vegan minced meat</li>
        <li>Vegatable oil</li>
        <li>Salcha</li>
        <li>4 big tomatoes or some canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p><strong>And how to do we cook this bad boy?</strong></p>
    <ol class="ol">
        <li>Peel the potatoes and slice them in cubes</li>
        <li>Dice the onion and pepper into small pieces</li>
        <li>Add the vegatable oil into the pot and heat up</li>
        <li>Add the minced meat and fry them until they're nicely brown</li>
        <li>Add cumin and black pepper</li>
        <li>Add onions and fry them as well until they change color</li>
        <li>Add tomato ans salca, mix them of for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Now add the peppers and mix it for 2 more minutes</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes</li>
        <li>Add some water only until it's above the potatoes on top</li>
        <li>Let it boil until the potatoes are nicely cooked</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
