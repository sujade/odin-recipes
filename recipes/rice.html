    <p>Do you know what's staple in Turkish cuisine? You got that right, rice!</p>
    <p>Making some rice with this method is pretty easy and it tastes very good at the end!</p>
    <p><strong>Let's check our ingredients first:</p></strong>
    <div class="container">
        <ul class="ul">
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable stock cubes</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The steps are very practical as well.</p></strong>
    <ol class="ol">
        <li>Grab a sieve and put the rice into the sieve. Then wash the rice under the running water for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile heat the pan and put some butter in there</li>
        <li>Don't forget to melt some stock inside hot water. The measurement is x1 glass of rice to x1,5 glasses of water</li>
        <li>Once the butter is nicely heated up, get the rice in there and start frying a bit with butter for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>When the time is over, add the water on top of it, cover it up. Keep it high temperature until it comes to boil. When it dones, low-mid heat is enough to cook some rice.</li>
        <li>If the rice is fully cooked, you can add the black pepper on top. It's ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This kind of rice is delicious on its own also with other kinds of food together.</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
