The project is about using the base HTML knowledge I have. Along with this, I'll try to add some flavor here and there to peresonalize this project a little, to my taste.

After being done with the project, I was able to implement basic CSS elements and use my newly gained knowledge about the box model. Creating a common .css file for recipe pages made me sure that I figured out a shortcut but I bet that this is a common method in such cases.

However, it cook me a while to come around with the box model properly, since initially I couldn't get some margins work properly. Right now, I've grasped the concept better and I'm ready to move on to Flexbox.

This project has been very educational because it has been the only project I've completed ever since I've started to learn HTML and CSS basics together. I guess one can say that this is my first project ever.
